UI for tools is all shitty; need to collapse tool request and tool call (or maybe
hide everything)

need to hook up end to end?

main_test is wild; just execute the underlying code dude
? slugs don't show up when they are generated still

things go too wide out of their box all the time

how does the system prompt work? Is it in the DB?


system promopt should include agent.md

UI should be embedded
